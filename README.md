# Welcome to Poki Party ðŸ‘‹

Curious about the world of Pokemon and the various creatures you can use to compete against other trainers?

Looking to go through the list of Pokemon you have at your disposal in your PC?

How about setting up various teams as a reference of balanced teams you have ready to go at your disposal?

Do all this and even some more in the Poki Party App!

## How to get started

First and foremost, this app uses Google Authentication to keep track of user data so make sure you're signed in!

### My Role: Working on Google OAuth and User's teams
+ What was the biggest challenge? 
  + Making the functionality to add pokemon from a user's pc to a team
+ Why was it a challenge?
  + I had to learn how a Modal works in React-Native, make the page the modal is on refetch database info, and handling multiple custom components
  + How was the challenge addressed?
    + I took it one step at a time and completed the database stuff, then created the modal, then attached the modal to another component
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project
  + I think my favorite part was either getting the modal to work, or integrating OAuth
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?
  + I would start working on Unit tests a lot earlier
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?
  + Probably how to actually create and manage a React-Native app. I can use it going forward and make it something I can possibly put on a resume.

## How's this app built?

This app is built through the use of React Native as a basic template to make the android app!

Following this, we also use Google Authentication to keep track of users info by making sure they sign in!

As for page traversal, we use the Expo System to flip between the main pages!
